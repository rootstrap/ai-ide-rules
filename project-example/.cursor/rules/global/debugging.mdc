# Debugging
- When asked to debug an issue or a bug, follow this sequence:
  1. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem.
  2. Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources.
  3. Add additional logs to validate your assumptions and track data transformations.
  4. Deeply reflect on what could be wrong and produce a comprehensive analysis.
  5. Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is unclear.
  6. Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove the added logs.
